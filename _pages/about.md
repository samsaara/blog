## Namaste 🙏

Thanks for visiting my humble abode on the Internet. I am Vivek, a freelance `Data Scientist` by profession.

**[Saṃsāra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%83s%C4%81ra)** means *World* in Sanskrit and I welcome you into mine where I blog about programming, among other things.

I have over 6 years of experience in Python & Machine Learning ecosystems across a broad variety of sectors ranging from Fashion :shopping: to Mobility :kick_scooter: to Fintech :currency_exchange:. 

At [Sezzle](https://sezzle.eu/), a platform offering [BNPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buy_now,_pay_later) service, I worked on developing and deploying early machine learning based fraud detection models. Prior to that at [FreeNow](https://www.free-now.com/de/), a mobility solutions provider, I worked on [GMV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_merchandise_volume) forecasting, churn prediction etc.

Apart from :snake: :computer: :bar_chart:, I am also interested in :man_farmer::tractor:, :musical_note:, :man_cook: and aim to know a little bit of everything I come across.

Please feel free to [reach me](mailto:vvaddina@pm.me) for any business, consulting or workshop opportunities. 😃

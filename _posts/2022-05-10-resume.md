## Experience

<a href="https://sezzle.eu"><font size="5rem"><i>Sezzle</i></font></a>
<br/> <font size="2rem">Berlin, Germany (Remote)</font>
<br/> <font size="2rem">Data Scientist</font>
<br/> <font size="2rem">Sep 2021 - May 2022</font>

- `Fraud Detection` - Conceptualized & developed a machine learning based model to counter fraud attempts during checkout.
    - Dockerised application made available as a micro service communicating via a REST API developed with FastAPI & validated with Pydantic.
    - Model was shown to be able to perform **~27%** better than the existing rules with a **>20%** improvement in detection of card transaction failure rate during backtesting.

<br/> <font size="2rem">Data Scientist</font>
<br/> <font size="2rem">May 2019 - Sep 2020</font>


- `Driver Churn Prediction` - Worked with CRM, Supply & Marketing teams to develop an end to end driver tour forecasting model that’s used for Churn prediction to engage with drivers early on with a starting accuracy of **~80%**.
    - Tasks included EDA, modeling, writing ETL, training & inference pipeline DAGs with Airflow. Data queried using Hive & Presto and models deployed with Docker, k8s on MLflow. Results were made easily accessible to stakeholders with a Metabase dashboard <i class="fa-solid fa-chart-line"></i>.
- `Quests Recommender System` - Worked on a framework to assign quests to drivers to increase their activity and steer supply when needed; aiming to improve KPIs like *Driver Acceptance Rate, Passenger Pickup Rate, RoI* etc. 
    - Tasks included predicting driver shifts based on their past activity, improving driver selection for quests by segmentation etc.
- `GMV Forecasting` - Reduced the prediction error by **20-60%** across all headquarters esp. by incorporating holidays and other events in a time-series forecasting model using Prophet.
- `Improving MRR for destination selection` - Combined users’ past destinations & essential local travel points to improve the list of top *X* destinations displayed on a limited mobile screen space; thereby helping users to type less and tap more. Designed a dashboard to showcase results with widgets in Redash.

<br/> <font size="2rem">Mar 2017 - Apr 2019</font>

- `Sales & Revenue Forecasting` - Developed machine learning models for optimizing incoming order quantities of seasonal fashion items and their arrivals to optimize sales and revenue.
- `Prototyping & PoC` - Designed UI and made a PoC to experiment with various properties of orders & sales such as changing order placement dates, quantities and base selling price etc. while offering predictions of sales/demand as a result in real time.
- `ETL` - Wrote ETL pipelines for huge volumes of data using Luigi & PySpark.
